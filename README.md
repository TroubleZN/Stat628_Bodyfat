# Stat628_Bodyfat
## Module 2: Developing a Robust, Scalable Obesity Metric for Health Policy Makers 

Module 2 will emphasize Aims (2) and (3), developing robust, scalable solutions to an already well-defined data science problem and communicating the analysis concisely and clearly to a policymaker. We will use the famous body fat data for this module (to be distributed later).

You will work in groups of three or four. Groups will be randomly assigned by the instructor. Each group will deliver the following items for grading.

1. An in-class presentation of your data analysis, followed by questions.
2. A concise, complete, and readable Github repo (e.g. polished/deliverable Jupyter/iPython notebook) that contains the relevant analysis, code, figures/tables. The Jupyter notebook should be concise, clean, replicable, and easy to follow.
3. A Shiny (or web-based) app/prototype based on your method.

These deliverables will be graded on a 1-3 scale.

Presentation schedules will be announced. All presentations will be held during lecture time at the lecture hall. All presentations will be videotaped for future review during class.
