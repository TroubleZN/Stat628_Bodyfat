### Goal:
This project is to provide a precise and accurate "rule of thumb" method to predict the percentage of body fat using clinical measurements. Furthermore, we construct a shiny app which could run our model in real time.

### Data:
- raw.csv: raw data
- cleaned.csv: data after preprocessing

### Code:
- Data_preprocessing.ipynb: 
- Modeling.ipynb: Stepwise procedure using AIC,BIC
- Diagnostic.ipynb: Robustness check
- Shiny: code for Shiny
