### Goal:
This project is to provide a precise and accurate "rule of thumb" method to predict the percentage of body fat using clinical measurements. Furthermore, we construct a shiny app which could run our model in real time.

### Data:
- BODYFAT_raw.csv: raw data of bodyfat measurements
- data_clean.csv: data after preprocessing

### Code:
An ipynb file including code for data preprocessing, modeling, diagnosis and shiny app.

### Image:
- Boxplots before and after data preprocessing
- Robustness Check: QQ plot, Scatterplot,
